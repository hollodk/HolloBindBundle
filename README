Introduction
------------

This bundle is a bundle to administrate your Linux Bind nameserver installation.

We have made a webinterface to administrate all the zones, those records are persistent in a database.

Then we have some commands which read changes in the database, and they automatically update Bind as it should be.


Getting started
---------------

Add the bundle to any of your existing projects, now all you have to do is:

  - Add the bundle to AppKernel.php
  - Add the bundle to autoload.php
  - Add the route to config/route.yml

Now go to the url:

http://localhost/admin/domain

You see a basic website with the important urls, that you can copy to fit what ever fits your needs.

In order to change the path for all the extends we have a oneliner to make the task quick for you.

  rgrep HolloBindBundle::base.html.twig . | cut -d':' -f1 | xargs sed -i "s/HolloBindBundle::base.html.twig/::base.html.twig/"


Commands
--------

Use this bundle in any way you want to, feel free to give me a pull request on github if you make any improvements.

Check out the commands it should be pretty self explaining what they do.


TODO
----

- validate IP addr
- validate hostname
- javascript confirm button on delete
- add up to 5 nameservers
