Introduction
------------

This bundle is a bundle to administrate your Linux Bind nameserver installation.

We have made a webinterface to administrate all the zones, those records are persistent in a database.

Then we have some commands which read changes in the database, and they automatically update Bind as it should be.


Dependency
----------

Its not really a requirement, but we are using HolloMenuBundle for the menu.


Getting started
---------------

Add the bundle to any of your existing projects, now all you have to do is:

  - Add the bundle to AppKernel.php
  - Add the bundle to autoload.php
  - Add the route to config/route.yml


If you want to see the basic routes checkout Resources/view/base.html.twig.


Commands
--------

Use this bundle in any way you want to, feel free to give me a pull request on github if you make any improvements.

Check out the commands it should be pretty self explaining what they do.


TODO
----

  - on a record validate hostname
  - on a record validate ip-addr
  - on cname validate hostname
  - on mx validate hostname
  - on ptr validate hostname
  - on ptr name has to be numeric between 0 and 255
  - javascript confirm button on delete
  - add pager to domain list
  - address of mx record cannot be null
  - support reverse dns
  - create converter from existing bind installation
  - add support for TXT records
  - make top menu with only domains and ptr, and move new to buttons
  - when listing, show what bind actually reads
  - make a converter from existing bind records
  - what about @, is it really needed?
