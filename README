Introduction
------------

This bundle is a bundle to administrate your Linux Bind nameserver installation.

We have made a webinterface to administrate all the zones, those records are persistent in a database.

Then we have some commands which read changes in the database, and they automatically update Bind as it should be.


Commands
--------

Use this bundle in any way you want to, feel free to give me a pull request on github if you make any improvements.

Check out the commands it should be pretty self explaining what they do.


Web interface
-------------

Use our sample base.html.twig file located in Resources/view/base.html.twig, in order to get all the important routing in this bundle.


TODO
----

- validate IP addr
- validate hostname
- javascript confirm button on delete
- add up to 5 nameservers
